# Helios

Welcome to Helios! Helios is a distributed computation network, it aims to allow you to assist friends with computing tasks, or just networks you join! A Helios network will essentially just be a bunch of computers communicating and deciding what to compute.
Maybe you need tp perform a floating point operation but your computer doesnt have a proper extension for it. Just go to the network and perform a "Float Operation Request" with the number of bits, and the network will attempt to find someone willing and capable of performing your request!
